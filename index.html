            13.17 eur (EUR should be in UPPERCASE) and 17.7 EUR (needs exactly two decimal places).
            15.89EUR has no space after EUR.
            17.37 doesn't have EUR and could be just any number.

            All 7 valid amounts of money should sum up to 1000.
            A valid amount is identified by " EUR " or " EUR," or " EUR." after a valid decimal number (\b) in the middle of the text.
            At the end of the text " EUR" is also valid. Linebreaks belong to the category of space characters.
